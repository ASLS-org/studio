# Modifier

Modifiers are some of the key components of [ASLS Studio](/). They offer a way to interract and manipulate a show's ressources such as [universe](/manual/modifiers/universe/), [Groups](/manual/modifiers/group/), [chases](/manual/modifier/chase/) and much more, live. They are placed at the bottom section of the app and can be accessed by interracting with both the [toolbar](/manual/interface/toolbar/) and [group pool](/manual/interface/grouppool/) interface components.

Modifiers are comprised of modifier-specific widgets that can be used in order to visualize, edit and store show properties.
