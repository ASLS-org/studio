# Patch Bay

Placed on the left-hand side of the interface, the patch bay is used to navigate through the show fixtures and universes quickly. Fixtures are ordered in groups of DMX universes.

Each individual DMX universe is listed under the menu's header. Selecting a universe will reveal the list of patched fixtures as well as the universe's editing tool under the [modifier](/interface/modifier/) section.

## Adding Fixtures

The patch button allows for universe creation and fixture patching. For further information please see [Patching Fixtures](/workflow/patching/) under the workflow section.

## Selecting Fixtures

One or many fixtures may be selected for deletion. to do so, you may either hold the <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> key and select multiple individual list entries or start by clicking on the first list entry index to be selected and select a second entry while holding the <kbd>`Shift`</kbd> key, thus resulting in the selection of every fixture in between these two indices.

The same method applies to every list present on the interface.

## Filtering Fixtures

Once patched, fixtures may be filtered by inputing a search string within the `Search` textbox. This allows for selection of same-type fixtures patched under different sets of universes.
